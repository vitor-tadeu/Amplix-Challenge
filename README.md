# Amplix-Challenge

</div>

Challenge to be promoted.

<div>
When I took this challenge, I never had contact with Web Development, only Mobile Development. When my boss came to inform me about the challenge, I was unsure whether to accept it or not, I always wanted to learn and that was an incentive that was missing to learn.
